CellMod
========
Current Version in Development: 4.0

CellMod is a plugin for Bukkit-compatible servers that provides text-based "cell phones" for player-to-player messaging.
This plugin can function as the only private messaging plugin on the server, but was orginally designed just for 
roleplaying purposes.  

CellMod is released as open-source under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 license.
